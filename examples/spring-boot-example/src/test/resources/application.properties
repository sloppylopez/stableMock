# Disable Spring Cloud compatibility verifier to allow OpenFeign 5.0.0 with Spring Boot 3.3.0
spring.cloud.compatibility-verifier.enabled=false

# Default URLs for tests (real APIs - used when StableMock is not active)
# When StableMock is active, @DynamicPropertySource will override these with
# dynamic WireMock URLs (random ports chosen at runtime).
# 
# Why @DynamicPropertySource is required:
# 1. WireMock ports are DYNAMIC (random free port chosen at runtime via findFreePort())
# 2. Tests run in PARALLEL (each test thread gets its own port)
# 3. The actual port is only known after WireMock starts in beforeAll/beforeEach
# You cannot hardcode the port in a profile because it's different each run!
